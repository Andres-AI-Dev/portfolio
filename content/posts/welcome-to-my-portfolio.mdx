# Welcome to My Portfolio

Hello! I'm Andres Gonzales, an AI Systems Architect/Engineer at Harlingen CISD. I'm an educator and innovator at heart who builds the technical infrastructure that powers learning across our district, while pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at UTRGV.

## My Journey

My path has been unconventional but deeply rooted in education. I started as an AP Chemistry Teacher at Harlingen School of Health Professions, where I discovered that I could combine my love for education with my passion for technology.

### Still an Educator, Just More Technical

I'm still very much in education, I just moved from the classroom to the technical side. During my time teaching, I realized I could have a bigger impact by building the tools and systems that help educators and students thrive. I love education, and I really, really love technology. Now I get to do both by creating AI solutions that directly serve our district.

## Current Work

### HCISD AI Application

I'm building a comprehensive AI-powered application for Harlingen CISD, which serves over 16,000 students across more than 30 campuses. The application integrates:

- React + Vite frontend
- Firebase backend
- Google Vertex AI
- Custom knowledge base

### Research

I'm actively involved in multiple research projects:

**At UTRGV's MARS Lab:**
- Multi-agent reinforcement learning for swarm robotics (MAPPO)
- Reinforcement learning algorithms for autonomous systems

**Human-AI Interaction Research:**
- Human-in-the-loop AI systems
- Trust in human-AI interaction and communication

## Highlights

In October 2025, I attended the Google for Education Leader Series in Chicago, where I networked with educational leaders from across the nation discussing AI implementation in K-12 education.

## What's Next

This blog will document my journey, share insights about AI in education, discuss technical challenges in ML/AI development, and explore the intersection of technology and learning.

Stay tuned for posts about:

- Building production AI applications
- Reinforcement learning for robotics
- Integrating AI into educational workflows
- Technical deep-dives into Firebase, Vertex AI, and more
