# HCISD Senior Seminar 2025: Where AI Meets Student Success

Last week, I had the privilege of attending HCISD's inaugural Senior Seminar, and honestly, it was one of the most rewarding experiences I've had since transitioning from the classroom to my current role as AI Systems Architect for the district.

## A Full Circle Moment

Here's what made this event special for me: I got to see my old students.

When I was teaching at Harlingen School of Health Professions, I never imagined I'd be back in a room with these same students, but in a completely different capacity. Seeing how far they've come, watching them engage with speakers, thinking about their futures, it hit different. These are the same kids I taught chemistry to, and now they're seniors preparing for life after graduation.

That's the thing about education that keeps pulling me back. Even though I've moved from the classroom to building AI systems for the district, I'm still an educator at heart. Events like this remind me why I made the transition in the first place: to have a bigger impact on student success across HCISD.

## Brian Romero Smith: A Googler on AI

One of the highlights of the seminar was [Brian Romero Smith Sr.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianromerosmith/), a K-12 Account Expert at Google and Education Solutions Partner. Brian presented on AI and how students can leverage it as they prepare for the workforce.

What I appreciated about Brian's presentation was how practical it was. He wasn't just talking theory. He was showing students real ways AI is changing the workplace and how they can use these tools to their advantage. For seniors about to enter college or the workforce, understanding AI isn't optional anymore. It's essential.

It was also cool to connect with Brian since we're both working in the Google for Education space. I attended the Google for Education Leader Series in Chicago just last month, so seeing another Googler investing in our students in the Rio Grande Valley felt like validation that we're on the right track with our AI initiatives.

## The Bigger Picture

This was HCISD's first year doing the Senior Seminar, and honestly, they nailed it. A huge shout out to Dr. Jessica Hruska, HCISD's Director of Innovative Practices, for organizing the whole event. Her vision for what student success looks like beyond academics is exactly what our district needs, and seeing it come together was really cool.

The conference-style program brought together stakeholders from across the community, all focused on one thing: preparing our seniors for success after graduation.

The seminar covered practical life skills that often get overlooked in traditional education: financial literacy, credit scores, workplace readiness, and yes, AI literacy. These are the things students actually need when they walk across that stage and into the real world.

I was there in a dual role. As the district's AI expert, I was representing our technology initiatives. But I was also there as a former teacher, helping set up, making sure everything ran smoothly, and just being present for the students. Sometimes you wear multiple hats, and that's okay.

## Why This Matters

Events like the Senior Seminar represent exactly what I love about HCISD. The district isn't just focused on test scores and graduation rates. They're investing in the whole student, preparing them for life beyond high school.

And for me personally, it's a reminder of why I do what I do. Every AI system I build, every tool I develop, it all comes back to this: helping students and educators succeed. Seeing my former students in that room, engaged and excited about their futures, that's the payoff.

Here's to many more Senior Seminars, and to watching these students go on to do amazing things.
