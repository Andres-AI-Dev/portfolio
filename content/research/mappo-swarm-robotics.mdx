Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) applied to swarm robotics for solving the foraging problem using Webots simulation.

## Overview

This research explores the application of MAPPO, a state-of-the-art multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm, to coordinate swarm robots in solving the foraging problem. The work is conducted at UTRGV's MARS Lab using Webots as the simulation environment.

## Research Focus

The foraging problem in swarm robotics involves coordinating multiple autonomous agents to efficiently search, collect, and transport resources in an environment. This research investigates how MAPPO can enable emergent cooperative behaviors in robot swarms without centralized control.

## Key Components

### Multi-Agent System
- Decentralized control architecture
- Agent-to-agent communication protocols
- Scalable coordination strategies

### MAPPO Algorithm
- Proximal Policy Optimization adapted for multi-agent scenarios
- Centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE)
- Shared value function approximation

### Simulation Environment
- Webots physics-based simulation
- Realistic robot dynamics and sensor models
- Configurable foraging scenarios

## Current Status

Active research in progress at UTRGV's MARS Lab as part of graduate studies in Computer Science, focusing on reinforcement learning and swarm robotics.
