Investigating dispositional and situational trust in AI-only, AI-assisted, and human-written emails to understand trust dynamics in human-AI communication.

## Overview

This research examines how people perceive and trust emails generated by AI systems compared to human-written communications. The study explores the nuanced differences between AI-only emails, AI-assisted emails, and purely human-written emails, focusing on trust formation and decision-making.

## Research Questions

### Primary Focus
- How does trust differ across AI-only, AI-assisted, and human-written emails?
- What role does disclosure play in trust formation?
- How do dispositional trust and situational trust interact in AI communication contexts?

### Trust Dimensions
- **Dispositional Trust**: Individual's general tendency to trust AI systems
- **Situational Trust**: Context-specific trust based on the particular email or scenario

## Methodology

### Email Categories
1. **AI-Only Emails**: Fully generated by AI without human intervention
2. **AI-Assisted Emails**: Human-written with AI enhancement or editing
3. **Human Emails**: Entirely written by humans without AI assistance

### Disclosure Conditions
- Disclosed AI involvement vs. undisclosed AI usage
- Impact of transparency on trust levels
- User preferences for disclosure

## Implications

This research has significant implications for:
- Organizational communication policies
- AI transparency guidelines
- Human-AI collaboration frameworks
- Trust-building in digital communications

## Current Status

Active research project at UTRGV's MARS Lab, investigating the intersection of human-computer interaction and trust in AI systems.
